      <h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
      <p>
        The series "Breaking Bad", created by Vince Gilligan, first aired on AMC
        in January 2008. The story of its creation is very interesting and is
        connected with an unusual idea. The idea for the series came to Gilligan
        during a conversation with a friend. They discussed the failures in life
        and Gilligan joked, saying: "You should just start producing
        methamphetamine." This banal conversation attracted attention to the
        unusual idea - about a man who begins to engage in a criminal business.
        Gilligan developed the concept of the series, inspired by stories about
        people whose lives change dramatically due to unexpected circumstances.
        He presented the story of Walter White, a chemistry teacher who, having
        learned about his cancer, decides to engage in drug production to
        provide for his family. Despite the unusual idea, "Breaking Bad" faced
        difficulties in finding a channel for its release. However, after
        showing a prototype of the episode at a script conference, AMC showed
        interest and the series was given the green light.
