                    Hello! My name is Yaroslav Bezvesilnyi, I am currently a 
                    student at the South East Technological University  where 
                    I am studying the course "Software Systems Development". 
                    This website is my project for the module "Website Development 1".
                </p> <hr>
                <p>
                    When I am not studying, I read a book, watch movies, go for walks. 
                    I believe that our hobbies shape us as much as our education!
                </p> <hr>
                <p>
                    On this site I would like to tell you about my interests and background.
                </p>
