            channels on YouTube, rap artist, singer and streamer. 
            A significant part of Internet users know who Kashin is, 
            or remembers a couple of lines from his songs.

        <p>Danila's biography began in Kazan in 1996, on November 6. 
            It's hard to find information about Kashin's parents. 
            In addition, judging by the sources, the data differs from each other. 
            It is known that the father is not alive, and the relationship with 
            the mother is not easy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since childhood, Danila was fond of music and dreamed of devoting 
            his whole life to it. As a teenager, Kashin tried to turn his hobby 
            into an art that everyone should know about. With the help of 
            an accessible program, the future blogger created tracks and 
            rapped with friends on the street. In 2011, he became interested 
            in "Youtube".

            Since 2016, DK has been a performer of his own tracks. 
            Clips shot together with other bloggers appeared. 
            Often the songs were based on a playing on words and strange plots. 
            Subscribers, for example, were delighted with the song "Doshirak".
            According to the authors, instant noodles are a prohibited substance 
            that can only be consumed underground. In 2017, DK and Crazy Mega Hell 
            released the clip "Memes". A few months later, the number of views 
            exceeded two million. 2018 was also eventful. In February, 
            the parody clip "B pisses off" was released, the popularity of 
            which was not yon the original from Marie Senn.
        </p>
        <p>On March 9, Danya presented a video for a track called "Love". 
            It is known that this DK text was inspired by the relationship 
            between rapper Faith and blogger Mariana Ro. As part of the 
            "Rap Akapelno" project, Kashin sang Mariana's song "Vzhuh-vzhuh". 
            The remake gained an incredible number of views and deserved 
            Roe's attention. The blogger appreciated the scale of Danila's 
            popularity and left a positive comment under the video. 
            Further, in April 2018, another track appeared - "The Hypocrite".
            In 2020, the blogger decided to diversify the content a little 
            and moved the broadcasts to Twitch. However, this move was not 
            very popular among Dani's fans and did not last long. 
            Later, Kashin returned to his former work on YouTube. 
            In parallel with blogging, the young man continued 
            his musical activities, introducing subscribers to the 
            author's novelties in social networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the summer of the same year, Danila presented to the public a clip 
            for the track "Everything is fine", and in November he pleased the 
            audience with another video - now for the song "Under the Moon". 
            In the Instagram account on the occasion of the release of the 
            composition, the blogger wrote a post in which he said that 
            he was initially preparing an EP, planning to include 3-4 tracks in it, 
            and some of them even managed to record. However, he soon realized that 
            "everything revolves around this demo", and decided to release 
            "Under the Moon" as a single. The musical composition continued the 
            following year - the track Ping Pong was released. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2022, under the new pseudonym Lil the Neel, Dania Kashin began 
            making rap music, but at the moment he is not continuing this project. 
            That same year, he returned to Twitch. This time, he began to have 
            success and by 2024, DK had gained a huge audience on this platform. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2024, DK released 2 hits - "Don't Plant Love" and "Night", 
            which sank into the hearts of viewers.
